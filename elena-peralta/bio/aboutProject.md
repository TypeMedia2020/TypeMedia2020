*Edonia* is a type family inspired by exploring the pointed nib. Searching for ways to change the flow of a typeface specifically designed for editorial purposes, it is a study of shapes and an attempt to approach calligraphy from a different point of view. Edonia is a calligraphic study, disrupting the vertical direction of the strokes by applying changes in the strokes direction. It navigates how round shapes and diagonal cuts are transposed by looking at the different ways that they can coexist in a system.

Each style of the family is a chance to embrace a trait of its personality. It ranges from exploring the limits and links between expansion and translation in the *Regular* text style, to the *Bold* text style that focuses on verticality, the *Italic* which embraces the familyâ€™s calligraphic roots, and finishes with its visual extreme is explored in the design of the compressed *Display.* *Edonia* is a dynamic and unique family for the publishing world.
