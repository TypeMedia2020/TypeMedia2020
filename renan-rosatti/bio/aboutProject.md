*Diafone* is a project that investigates the variety of voices available within one publication and proposes a different way to organize and structure a typeface for magazines. Each of the 5 styles are designed with a specific size and function in mind: the text styles are for body copy; the mono can be used for captions as well as a bold for the text; and the display styles can shine in larger sizes. This makes it possible to set an entire publication using *Diafone.*
The goal of the type family is not to achieve a uniform voice, but rather to establish a hierarchy, in which each style fulfills a different role and offers a unique personality. Through this variety of voices, *Diafone* offers a creative alternative for traditional font pairing for magazines and all kinds of editorial applications.
*Diafone* was awarded Merit of the *Gerard Unger Scholarship 2020.*
