Arnaud likes to compare his project to a traditional dish which would never disappear. The project is detailed and built to last. *Epitre* is a text typeface family in which the lowercase construction is based on the roman capital principles. The aim was to create a more consistent relation between both upper and lower Latin alphabets. The design started from a calligraphic base, using a single broad brush, leading him to a very classical approach, sprinkled with an English touch. The text styles aim to be pretty invisible, as “it is a far more difficult to be simple than to be complicated”. A particular attention has been given to vertical metrics, contrast amount, proportions and spacing in order to achieve the most harmonious effect in reading size.
