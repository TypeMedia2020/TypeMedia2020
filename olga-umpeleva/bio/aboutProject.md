*Noordenwind* is a typeface inspired by the turbulent Dutch winds, which blow in all directions simultaneously. *Noordenwind* starts from a simple place. There are not enough serifs in our typefaces. Why should serifs only be present in certain places? Why is it not possible to add them elsewhere? In *Noordenwind,* Olga combines her interests in crazy display types and clean san serifs by designing a family of 3 sans-serif display styles, 2 serif displays, and one text style.
