*Version* is inspired by the distortions that occur in visual reproduction processes. The collection consists of 4 experimental variable fonts (11 sources), which are optimized for large sizes and animation. Each of them explores how factors such as medium, resolution, optical distortion, movement, and perspective influence shapes and contours. 
By questioning conventions in type design the project offers a new perspective on legibility and reading habits. While type designers usually use components or repeating shapes across the different letters of one style, each character in *Version* is drawn separately, there are no repeating parts or details. To enhance this seemingly random effect there are up to three alternates per letter, which can be interpolated.
