*Ceres* is a typeface with a macabre atmosphere. The initial idea was to give different characters of a story their own typographic voice. I wanted to capture the personification of *Death,* a character in the stories of Terry Pratchett, in a typeface. The plan changed, but the inspiration stayed the same. Ceres developed into a diverse family of five styles: *Scythe Roman* and *Italic* for larger sizes, and *Sickle Light* to *Bold* for smaller sizes.

The *Scythe Roman* owes its name to the sharply curved serifs, whose shapes are reminiscent of a scythe. The *Italic,* on the other hand, interprets the underlying theme in a completely different way. Its fluid curves with horn-like ends create the wickedly diabolical character.
Developing the counterpart for smaller uses was much more challenging. It needed linear details and a sturdier look. While the *Light* weight is an adaption of the *Scythe* style, used in smaller text; *Regular* and *Bold* deviate further from the shapes and are specially adapted for longer texts.â€¨
