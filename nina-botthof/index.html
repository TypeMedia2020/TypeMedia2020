     <h1>
      Ceres
     </h1>
     <p>
      <em>
       Ceres
      </em>
      is a typeface with a macabre atmosphere. The initial idea was to give different characters of a story their own typographic voice. I wanted to capture the personification of
      <em>
       Death,
      </em>
      a character in the stories of Terry Pratchett, in a typeface. The plan changed, but the inspiration stayed the same. Ceres developed into a diverse family of five styles:
      <em>
       Scythe Roman
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Italic
      </em>
      for larger sizes, and
      <em>
       Sickle Light
      </em>
      to
      <em>
       Bold
      </em>
      for smaller sizes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <em>
       Scythe Roman
      </em>
      owes its name to the sharply curved serifs, whose shapes are reminiscent of a scythe. The
      <em>
       Italic,
      </em>
      on the other hand, interprets the underlying theme in a completely different way. Its fluid curves with horn-like ends create the wickedly diabolical character.
Developing the counterpart for smaller uses was much more challenging. It needed linear details and a sturdier look. While the
      <em>
       Light
      </em>
      weight is an adaption of the
      <em>
       Scythe
      </em>
      style, used in smaller text;
      <em>
       Regular
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Bold
      </em>
      deviate further from the shapes and are specially adapted for longer texts.

     Process
    </h3>
    <p>
     The very first thought on this project emerged when I saw the use of smallcaps to highlight the voice of
     <em>
      Death
     </em>
     in Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. This typographical hint sparked the idea that type can play a special role in storytelling. I grew fond of the idea to tailor a typeface to represent only the character of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought of some characteristics that are apparent for the character and made a TypeCooker recipe based on adjectives:
     <em>
      stiff, daunting, bone-like, strong, morbid
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      peculiar.
     </em>
     With these characteristics, I sketched as many different designs as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="" src="/nina-botthof/process/nina-botthof-process-1.png">
     </img>
    </p>
    <p>
     I noticed a preference for light weights and realised that I needed to focus on the sharpness of the drawings. The serifs needed to be pointy to create a dangerous and uncomfortable looking typeface. I started to digitise and experimented with different serif treatments. The culmination of weight in the
     <em>
      Light
     </em>
     style was an interesting feature that I wanted to explore further. With bracketed serifs I could put even more weight on these joints which resulted in a rather organic looking texture.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="" src="/nina-botthof/process/nina-botthof-process-2.png">
     </img>
    </p>
    <p>
     Designing a corresponding text version was rather difficult. I wanted to keep the sharpness of the
     <em>
      Display
     </em>
     design, and optimise it for reading sizes. But I was never really satisfied with how the styles worked together. Therefore I wanted to explore some other possible styles: an
     <em>
      Italic
     </em>
     and a
     <em>
      Bold
     </em>
     for the
     <em>
      Display
     </em>
     style and an
     <em>
      Optical Size.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Designing the
     <em>
      Italic
     </em>
     came to me quite easily. I made several different drafts and soon decided on a playful version with twisted stroke endings.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="" src="/nina-botthof/process/nina-botthof-process-3.png">
     </img>
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <em>
      Bold
     </em>
     style was much more challenging. How would the weight behave? Would it have reversed contrast, or would it gain weight in the stems? I tried both options and experimented with a three-master-interpolation to see how the weight inbetween behaves.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="" src="/nina-botthof/process/nina-botthof-process-4.png">
     </img>
    </p>
    <p>
     For the
     <em>
      Optical Size
     </em>
     I interpolated the display with a sketch that was designed with more weight and less contrast. Then I also created a bold master for this
     <em>
      Optical Size
     </em>
     to explore what a regular weight could look like.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were so many possible styles to explore, but I knew that I would not be able to finish all of them for my final project, so I had to make a choice. I decided to take a step back and have a critical look on which styles are most useful. For this purpose I did a small experimental layout to see the potential of my styles.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="" src="/nina-botthof/process/nina-botthof-process-5.png">
     </img>
    </p>
    <p>
     I already knew that I wanted to continue to work on the
     <em>
      Display Roman
     </em>
     and the
     <em>
      Italic.
     </em>
     But this test also showed me that the
     <em>
      Optical Size
     </em>
     worked well together with the
     <em>
      Display
     </em>
     styles.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first the design of the
     <em>
      Optical Size
     </em>
     had an irregular rhythm, because the weight was not consistent throughout all glyphs, especially in the bolder weights. This was also due to the reversed contrast model. Therefore I decided to make the
     <em>
      Bold
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      Regular
     </em>
     more upright and to have an increase in angle from
     <em>
      Light
     </em>
     to
     <em>
      Bold.
     </em>
     I also adjusted the proportions to have longer ascenders and decenders and a larger cap-height in order to improve reading quality.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="" src="/nina-botthof/process/nina-botthof-process-6.png">
     </img>
    </p>
    <p>
     After refining all styles, I noticed that they do not fit in the Display/Optical Size model that I originally thought of. Therefore it seemed to be suitable to think of more abstract terms to describe their purposes. I finally decided to group them into
     <em>
      Scythe
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      Sickle,
     </em>
     not only because the terms are an abstract metaphor for large and small, but also because they fit the theme.
