			<p>Type and Media is a master’s course in typeface design at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague (KABK). During the first semester, the students have several ongoing modules with concurrent projects, interspersed with a diverse set of workshops. During the second semester, each student focuses on a single project. This site showcases the final projects of the class of 2019. Enjoy!</p>

				<h1>Ceres</h1>
				<p>Ceres is a typeface with a macabre atmosphere. My first idea was to give different characters of a story their own typographic voice. I wanted to capture the personification of death, a character in the stories of Terry Pratchett, in a typeface. The plan changed, but the inspiration stayed the same. Ceres developed into a diverse family of five styles: Scythe Roman and Italic for larger sizes, and Sickle Light to Bold for smaller sizes. The Scythe Roman owes its name to the sharply curved serifs, whose shape is slightly reminiscent of a scythe. The Italic, on the other hand, interprets the underlying theme in a completely different way. Its fluid curves with horn-like ends create the wickedly diabolical character. Developing the counterpart for smaller uses was much more challenging. I chose linear details and a sturdier look. While the light weight is an adaption of the Scythe style, but for use in smaller text; Regular and Bold deviate further from the shapes and are specially adapted for longer texts.</p>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>The catalyst of Diafone was an assignment from Peter Bilak which consisted of designing one word in two interpolatable styles based on an adjective and its antonym. The adjective I chose was fierce, for which I drew a slanted roman with heavy asymmetrical serifs. For the opposite extreme, tame, I drew something inoffensive, in the shape of a sturdy and straightforward text style. The result of this exercise sparked my interest for two ideas that became pillars of the concept of Diafone.</p>

			<p>Firstly, the slanted roman construction and the explorations of terminals and ductus within this style. Then was the concept of building a family around an adjective axis instead of more traditional ways of organizing styles according to weight and width. I wanted to find a place between the two extremes exemplified here by Adrian Frutiger’s Univers—in which all styles are cohesive and have the same voice—and Nikola Djurek and Marko Hrastovec’s Audree—a toolbox for designers to tailor a style that suits perfectly one specific application.</p>

			<p>My goal was a typeface with different styles that work together in a page of text, but offer the designer options for different roles and tones of voice. From the beginning, I wanted to be guided by a specific environment where the typeface is meant to be used. I believed that working this way I would be able to make decisions more objectively and define a more interesting and useful scope for the project. The choice of magazines as the application came from my personal background. I worked in that field for some years and also have collected independent magazines for a while, so this was a context I’ve always wanted to design for, and this felt like a good opportunity.</p>
