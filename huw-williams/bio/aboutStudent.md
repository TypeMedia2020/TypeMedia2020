Huw Williams is a type designer from the United Kingdom of Great Britain. As a retired climber, Huw abandoned the rock to live a more sedentary life of black and white, up and down, left and right. Now instead of worrying about friction and two finger pockets, he concerns himself with over obsessive point placements, confusing research proposals and what the French are doing (have done).
