*Malham* is a type family that explores the middle ground between sans and serif. Malham became an amalgamation of a few distinct areas of typographic research including:

- Examples of type that could be construed as *SemiSerif*
- American sign painting and brush lettering.
- Rationalized blackletter from the same geographical location.
- Eclectic forms of vernacular type.

And over a handful of months, the project transformed into something completely unexpected. While still keeping an air of familiarity and ubiquity to its shapes.

The *Malham* family is comprised of two main styles: *Display* and *Text.* The *Display* styles lean heavily on the findings of the R&D phase of the project. While the *Text* styles leave the idiosyncratic blackletter and brush lettering influences behind, elaborating on some of the more Dwiggins-esque qualities to better function at smaller sizes.
